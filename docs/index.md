# DeepMIMO

Welcome to DeepMIMO Documentation!

DeepMIMO manages the largest database of ray tracing scenarios. DeepMIMO is offered as an open-source Python package and provides tools to generate realistic MIMO channels and use them with 5G/6G simulation tools.

DeepMIMO is developed and used by the [Wireless Intelligence Lab](https://wi-lab.net/) for 6G research.
