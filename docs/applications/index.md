# Applications

This section contains advanced, real-world examples and applications of DeepMIMO that go beyond basic tutorials. These examples demonstrate complete end-to-end workflows for specific use cases.

## Available Applications

- **[Channel Prediction](1_channel_prediction.py)**: Complete workflow for creating realistic channel sequences for ML-based channel prediction, covering interpolation techniques, Doppler effects, and comparative analysis.

## How Applications Differ from Tutorials

**Tutorials** focus on teaching specific DeepMIMO features and APIs in isolation.

**Applications** show complete end-to-end workflows for real use cases, often combining multiple features and demonstrating best practices for production scenarios.
