# Pipelines

DeepMIMO pipelines provide systematic workflows for massive creation of ray tracing datasets around the world.

## Coming Soon

We are actively developing pipeline features to cover the world with ray tracing scenarios. 

Our current pipelines support Sionna 0.19-1.0 and Wireless InSite 3.3-4.0. 

We should release these pipelines before August.
Please contact us directly if this is something you would be interested in.
