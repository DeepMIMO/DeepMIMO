# Integrations

DeepMIMO integrates with various external tools and frameworks. This allows the user to choose the tool they prefer for simulations, while accessing the DeepMIMO database. 

The purpose of integrations is to extend simulation tools with hundreds of pre-raytraced scenarios, and extend DeepMIMO with the capabilities of each tool.

## Coming Soon

We are actively developing integrations.

We should release these integrations before August.
Please contact us directly if this is something you would be interested in.

## Sionna Integration

[Sionna](https://github.com/NVlabs/sionna) is an open-source GPU-accelerated library for link- and system-level simulations.

See the [DeepMIMO Integration Notebook in Sionna Docs](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/phy/tutorials/DeepMIMO.html) for a complete example of the integration. It mainly leverages the Sionna Adapter. 

```{eval-rst}

.. autoclass:: deepmimo.integrations.sionna_adapter.SionnaAdapter

```


## MATLAB 5G Toolbox

[MATLAB 5G Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/5g.html) provides standard-compliant functions and reference examples for the modeling, simulation, and verification of 5G and 5G-Advanced communications systems.
