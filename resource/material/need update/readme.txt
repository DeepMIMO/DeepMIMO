These files are directly copied from WI built-in material folder.
However, the numerical precision for the parameters (conductivity.. etc...) may cause the p2m generated by python different than WI.
These materials need to be first manually load to WI GUI and save the WI scenario. And check what WI GUI do to the numerical precision.
This is a must for the p2m generated by python to match the p2m generated by WI
